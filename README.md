## Tom "Nugget" 👨‍🎓

Hey, I'm a final year METR and Comp Sci student at UQ, or a glorified Software Engineering student who knows some stuff about kinematics and PCBs.

Most of my repositories are private since they're academic, including my Honours Thesis (boo) where I wrote an application to track and display the movement of a human leg 🦿 and designed the circuit boards. 🖥  

A lot of my downtime is spent on the drums 🥁, or whatever instrument I'm interested in at the time 🎸.

Anyway here are some stats to jazz up this page:
